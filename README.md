Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, capturing the imagination of generations and serving as a poignant reminder of the fragility of human life. On the fateful night of April 15, 1912, the supposedly unsinkable Titanic collided with an iceberg in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic, leading to the loss of over 1,500 lives. Amidst the tragedy, stories of heroism, sacrifice, and survival emerged, painting a vivid picture of the harrowing events that unfolded aboard the ill-fated vessel.
The Titanic's demise sparked widespread fascination and intrigue, prompting numerous inquiries, investigations, and adaptations in popular culture. However, beyond the realm of historical curiosity lies a trove of data that offers a unique opportunity to explore the human dimensions of the disaster. The Titanic dataset, containing detailed information about the passengers and crew onboard the ship, serves as a window into the lives, backgrounds, and ultimately, the fate of those aboard.
At its core, the Titanic Survival Prediction project seeks to harness the power of data science and machine learning to delve deeper into the mysteries surrounding the Titanic disaster. By analyzing the wealth of information contained within the dataset, the project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that shed light on the factors influencing survival in the face of adversity.
Through the lens of data science, the project endeavors to answer compelling questions such as:
•	What demographic factors contributed to higher survival rates among passengers?
•	Did passenger class, gender, age, or other attributes play a significant role in determining survival outcomes?
•	How did socioeconomic status, family size, and other variables impact an individual's chances of survival?
•	Are there discernible patterns or correlations that offer clues about human behavior and decision-making during times of crisis?
By interrogating the dataset with a data-driven approach, the project not only seeks to unravel the mysteries of the Titanic disaster but also to draw broader insights into human behavior, resilience, and the pursuit of survival in the face of extraordinary circumstances.
